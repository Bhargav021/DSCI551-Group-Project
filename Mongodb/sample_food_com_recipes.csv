Put 200g of â00â flour on a wooden board, make a hole in the centre and break the eggs in, add a drop of olive oil and a pinch of salt and with a fork then break up the eggs slowly pulling down the flour a bit at a time. Once this step is complete we move on to the âmassageâ phase. Knead the dough with your hands until it becomes soft and compact and stretches when pulled, once it reaches the right consistency leave it to rest for around 30 min in a cool place."", 
""Now comes the most delicate phase of the making of the pasta (in the local âCossignaneseâ dialect this is called the âpannellaâ) it is made by rolling using a long wooden pasta rolling-pin to stretch out the dough until it becomes 2mm thin. Use a little four to prevent the dough sticking to the board or rolling pin. It is important to keep all parts of the dough at a similar thickness as it thins out. Start with your hands near the centre of the rolling pin and move them to the ends of the pin as you roll so as to keep an even pressure over the whole area of the dough. Occasionally lift the dough and dust with flour underneath to ensure it does not stick. A special long thin rolling-pin is required to avoid creating flat spots on the pasta as the area of the dough increases."", 
""At this point the dough can lightly rolled up and cut with a knife to create thin strips 3/4m for âmaccheroncinoâ and 7/8mm for âtagliatellaâ strips. The pasta is ready to use and since it is fresh it takes only a couple of minutes in boiling water to reach the âal denteâ (to the tooth) stage. It can be topped with any suitable sauce: perfect is a âraguâ meat sauce but equally good is a mushroom or fish sauce."", ""Ragu."", ""In Cossignano the ragu is made with ground beef and pork. This is not âminceâ that you might buy in a supermarket. In Italy we buy a piece of meat and ask the butcher to grind it for us so we know exactly what we are eating. Fry a finely chopped onion in a little olive oil, when it becomes soft and translucent add a diced carrot and a chopped stick of celery and cook together for a few minutes. Add 200 grams ground beef and 100 grams of minced pork, brown it with the addition of a glass of red wine. As soon as the meat is browned add salt and pepper to taste pop in a parmesan rind and pour about a quart of passata di pomodoro â pureed tomatoes. Cook for about two hours covered over low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent the sauce from sticking to the bottom.""

In the gravy, I used a can of French Onion soup as well as a can of Cream of Mushroom and a packet of Dry Onion Soup or sauteed onions. I omitted the salt due to the high sodium content in the soups. I'm glad I did. I doubled the gravy except for the ketchup -- kept it at 1/4 cup while doubling the rest. I also added a jar of mushrooms to the gravy. After browning each side of the patties (and yes, having them fall apart slightly), I transferred the patties to a foil-lined casserole dish, put the gravy on top, covered the dish, and cooked it at 375*F. for 45 minutes. I was worried the patties wouldn't get all the way done because they were pretty thick, but they turned out perfect! so simple to make. So, if you're craving an old cafeteria food favorite - don't waste your time with the recipe for the sauce - buy a box of Lipton Mushroom Onion soup mix and make the gravy with it - you won't regret it! We had it with brown rice (and had just enough wonderful gravy to go along with it!) and steamed broccoli. This is a new favorite recipe for my wife and me. For those who had trouble keeping the patties together, try this it was suggested to me. Instead of cooking in a skillet, place browned patties in a foil-lined casserole dish, pour gravy over top, and bake at 400 for 30 minutes Your patties will stay together nicely! I do like to play with my food. I would love to hear any improvements and/or variations you make to this simple recipe. Enjoy!""

But oh so good.  Now I found pomegranate seeds at Whole Foods, but my Publix grocery store has fresh pomegranate at 1/6th the cost.  Secret to cleaning them.  One  --  wear a dark shirt, two stand over the sink  --  three DO NOT use a wood cutting board.  Cut in half and then again in half.  In a bowl of water pull the seeds away from the membrane and pulp.  The seeds sink, the pulp floats.  Then just scoop out the membrane and the seeds are ready to enjoy.  That easy.  It is definitely a treat."", 
""Couscous  --  Now, just follow the instructions.  Most of the quick cooking brands will require 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 cups water.  Personally, I use chicken stock.  It adds so much flavor. For the most part, I just boil the water in a medium bowl in the microwave, remove, add the couscous, stir once and cover with a plate. Let set 5 minutes.  While you let the couscous set, you need to grill the lamb.  Then as the lamb rests you can flavor your couscous."", ""To the couscous  --  add in the pistachios, lemon zest, cilantro, cinnimon, olive oil and the pomegranate seeds, a little pepper (salt if you want) but the broth is salty."", 
""Lamb  --  Now as the couscous rests grill your lamb. I prefer the outside grill, but a inside grill pan will be just fine.  Medium high heat brushed with olive oil. You could also use a cast iron pan as well for this.  Just brush off most of the yogurt marinade so it doesn't sweat but browns as it cooks. Grill 5-7 minutes per side until you see nice grill marks and then remove.  You want them medium rare about 140 degrees.  A thermometer is very helpful at this point unless you are very comfortable with judging the doneness of the meat. Don't over cook.  Remove and just cover to let them rest."", 
""Finish up your couscous as they cook and then serve 2 chops per person over a nice bed of the couscous.  A nice saute of spinach, kale or swiss chard to me is a great side or maybe just some roasted green beans or even broccoli. This makes a beautiful dish served to company.  A little expensive with the lamb, but such a nice treat.  And besides the couscous, vegetables are inexpensive, so my philosophy is spend money on one main item to focus on and cut back on other items.  You guests will never know and they will love it regardless.""
