      "**Speedy Chickpea & Spinach Scramble with Toast**\n",
      "\n",
      "This recipe relies on canned chickpeas for speed and incorporates spinach for added nutrients.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Yields:** 1 serving\n",
      "**Prep time:** 5 minutes\n",
      "**Cook time:** 10-15 minutes\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ingredients:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   1 tablespoon olive oil\n",
      "*   1/4 cup chopped onion\n",
      "*   1 clove garlic, minced\n",
      "*   1/2 teaspoon cumin powder\n",
      "*   1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder\n",
      "*   1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)\n",
      "*   1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained\n",
      "*   1/4 cup Vegetable broth \n",
      "*   1/4 cup chopped tomatoes\n",
      "*   2 cups fresh spinach\n",
      "*   1 tablespoon lemon juice\n",
      "*   Salt and pepper to taste\n",
      "*   1-2 slices whole-wheat toast (or your favorite bread)\n",
      "*   Optional toppings: Avocado slices, everything bagel seasoning, hot sauce\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Prep:**  Rinse and drain the chickpeas. Chop the onion, garlic, and tomatoes.\n",
      "2.  **Sauté Aromatics:** Heat the olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic and sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until softened.\n",
      "3.  **Add Spices & Chickpeas:** Stir in the cumin, turmeric, and red pepper flakes (if using). Cook for another minute until fragrant. Add the rinsed and drained chickpeas to the skillet.\n",
      "4.  **Mash & Sauté:** Using a fork or potato masher, lightly mash some of the chickpeas in the skillet (this helps create a scramble-like texture). Add the vegetable broth and stir to combine. Cook for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chickpeas are heated through and slightly softened.\n",
      "5.  **Wilt Spinach:** Add the fresh spinach to the skillet and stir until it wilts, about 1-2 minutes.\n",
      "6.  **Season & Finish:** Stir in the lemon juice, chopped tomatoes, salt, and pepper to taste. Mix well.\n",
      "7.  **Toast Bread:** While the chickpea scramble is cooking, toast your bread.\n",
      "8.  **Serve:** Spoon the chickpea and spinach scramble over the toasted bread. Top with optional toppings like avocado slices, everything bagel seasoning, or a dash of hot sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why it's high in protein and fast:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Chickpeas:**  A great source of plant-based protein and fiber.\n",
      "*   **Speed:**  Canned chickpeas cut down on cooking time significantly.  The spinach wilts quickly, and the spices add flavor fast.\n",
      "*  **Lemon Juice:** helps to better absorb Iron from Spinach.\n",
      "*   **Toast:** provides complex carbs for sustained energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tips & Variations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Spice Level:** Adjust the amount of red pepper flakes to your preference.\n",
      "*   **Other Veggies:** Feel free to add other quick-cooking vegetables like chopped bell peppers or mushrooms to the sauté.\n",
      "*   **Egg Alternative (Optional):** For a richer flavor and texture, you can whisk 1-2 eggs or egg whites and pour them into the skillet with the spinach. Cook until set, stirring gently to create a scramble.\n",
      "*   **Make it Vegan:** Ensure your bread is vegan-friendly.  Omit the optional egg alternative.\n",
      "*   **Cheese:** Add a sprinkle of feta cheese after cooking for extra flavor and a bit more protein (if you're not vegan).\n",
