give me one dish i can cook under 20 minutes
A classic and quick dish you can cook in under 20 minutes is **aglio e olio** (spaghetti with garlic and oil). It's simple, flavorful, and only requires a handful of ingredients you likely already have on hand: spaghetti, garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. You can even add a sprinkle of parmesan cheese at the end if you like!
I am going to workour in 20 minutes. Give me one high calorie meal that i can cook quickly before i go to workout.
Okay, here's a quick, high-calorie meal you can whip up in about 20 minutes before your workout: **Oatmeal with Nut Butter, Seeds, and Fruit** * **Why it works:** Oatmeal provides sustained energy from complex carbohydrates. Nut butter offers healthy fats and protein, and the seeds add extra calories and nutrients. Fruit provides quick-digesting sugars for a boost. * **Ingredients:** * 1/2 cup Rolled Oats (Quick-cooking preferred) * 1 cup Milk (Dairy or Non-Dairy - full fat for more calories) or Water * 2 tablespoons Nut Butter (Peanut, Almond, Cashew, etc.) * 1 tablespoon Seeds (Chia, Flax, Hemp) * 1/2 Banana, sliced (or other fruit like berries) * Honey or Maple Syrup (optional, for extra sweetness/calories) * **Instructions:** 1. **Cook the Oats:** Combine oats and milk/water in a microwave-safe bowl or saucepan. Microwave on high for 1-2 minutes (or cook on stovetop according to package directions) until oats are soft and creamy. 2. **Mix it Up:** Stir in the nut butter and seeds. 3. **Top it Off:** Add the sliced banana (or other fruit) on top. Drizzle with honey or maple syrup if desired. * **Why it's quick:** It's all about minimal cooking and easy assembly. Enjoy your workout!

give me the cooking instructions for Bombay Biryani
Okay, here's a general guideline for cooking Bombay Biryani. Keep in mind that recipes vary considerably, so this is a composite based on common elements. You'll want to find a specific recipe online or in a cookbook for more precise measurements and times, as this is just a summary of the method. **Bombay Biryani: A General Cooking Guide** **Key Characteristics:** * **Potatoes:** A hallmark of Bombay Biryani. * **Sweetness & Tang:** Often includes dried plums (prunes), fried onions, and sometimes yogurt for a balance of flavors. * **Spice Blend:** A rich and complex blend, often including garam masala, red chili powder, turmeric, ginger-garlic paste, and other aromatics. * **Saffron:** Used to infuse the rice with color and aroma. * **Meat:** Usually chicken, mutton (goat/lamb), or beef. **Ingredients (General Guide):** * **Meat:** About 1-1.5 lbs of your chosen meat, cut into pieces. * **Rice:** 2 cups of good quality Basmati rice. * **Potatoes:** 2-3 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered or cubed. * **Onions:** 2-3 large onions, thinly sliced. Some will be fried to a crisp golden brown (birista) and some will be used in the gravy. * **Tomatoes:** 2-3 medium tomatoes, chopped. * **Ginger-Garlic Paste:** 2-3 tablespoons. * **Green Chilies:** 2-4, slit or chopped (adjust to taste). * **Yogurt:** 1/2 cup (plain, full-fat yogurt is preferred, optional) * **Dried Plums (Prunes):** 6-8, pitted (optional). * **Mint & Cilantro:** Fresh, chopped, for garnish. * **Ghee or Oil:** For cooking. * **Whole Spices:** Bay leaves, cardamom pods (green and/or black), cloves, cinnamon stick, peppercorns. * **Ground Spices:** Turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala. * **Saffron:** A pinch, soaked in warm milk or water. * **Salt:** To taste. * **Biryani Essence/Kewra Water:** Optional, for added aroma. **Steps:** 1. **Prepare the Rice:** * Wash the Basmati rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. * Soak the rice in water for at least 30 minutes (this helps it cook evenly). * Parboil the rice: In a large pot, bring water to a boil with a bay leaf, a few cloves, and some salt. Add the soaked rice and cook until it's about 70-80% cooked (the grains should still be firm in the center). Drain the rice and set aside. * Soak saffron strands in warm milk. 2. **Fry the Onions:** * Thinly slice the onions. * Heat oil or ghee in a heavy-bottomed pot or pan. * Fry the onions in batches until they are a deep golden brown and crispy (birista). Remove them and set aside. Be careful not to burn them. 3. **Prepare the Meat Gravy (Masala):** * In the same pot (after removing excess oil, if any), add some more ghee or oil. * Add the whole spices (bay leaf, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon) and let them sizzle for a few seconds. * Add the remaining sliced onions and sauté until golden brown. * Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté until the raw smell disappears. * Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften. * Add the ground spices (turmeric, red chili powder, coriander, cumin, garam masala) and sauté for a minute or two, adding a little water if needed to prevent burning. * Add the meat and potatoes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is browned on all sides. * Add yogurt (if using) and cook for a few more minutes. * Add enough water to cover the meat and potatoes. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the meat and potatoes are tender. Adjust the cooking time based on the type of meat (mutton/lamb will take longer than chicken). * Add salt to taste. * Add dried plums in last 10-15 minutes of cooking the gravy. 4. **Layering and Dum Cooking:** * In a heavy-bottomed pot (the same one you used for the gravy, if suitable, or a new one), create layers: * Start with a layer of the meat gravy. * Then, a layer of parboiled rice. * Sprinkle some fried onions, chopped mint, and cilantro over the rice. * Drizzle some of the saffron milk over the rice. * Repeat the layers: gravy, rice, fried onions, herbs, saffron milk. The final layer should be rice. * **Dum Cooking (Sealing and Slow Cooking):** This is crucial for biryani. There are a few methods: * **Traditional Method:** Seal the pot tightly with a lid. Place a layer of dough (made from flour and water) around the rim of the pot to create a tight seal. Place the pot on a very low flame (or on a *tawa* – a flat griddle – to prevent burning) for 30-45 minutes. * **Modern Method:** Cover the pot tightly with a lid. You can place a heavy object on top of the lid to help seal it. Cook on very low heat for 30-45 minutes. * **Oven Method:** Cover the pot tightly with foil and then the lid. Bake in a preheated oven at 325°F (160°C) for 30-45 minutes. 5. **Rest and Serve:** * After the dum cooking is complete, turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for 10-15 minutes *without opening the lid*. This allows the flavors to meld. * Gently fluff the rice with a fork, being careful not to break the grains too much. * Serve hot, garnished with more fresh cilantro and fried onions. Bombay Biryani is often served with raita (yogurt dip). **Tips:** * **Quality Ingredients:** Use the best quality Basmati rice and fresh spices you can find. * **Don't Overcook the Rice:** Parboiling is key. Overcooked rice will result in a mushy biryani. * **Low and Slow:** The dum cooking process is essential for developing the flavors and aromas of the biryani. Be patient and cook it on a low flame. * **Adjust Spices:** Adjust the amount of chili powder and other spices to your preference. * **Experiment:** Biryani is a dish with endless variations. Feel free to experiment with different spices and ingredients to create your own signature version. **Important Disclaimer:** Cooking times are approximate and will vary depending on your stove, pot, and ingredients. Always check the meat for doneness. Use a food thermometer to ensure the meat is cooked to a safe internal temperature. Remember to always consult a proper recipe for exact measurements and instructions. Happy cooking!
